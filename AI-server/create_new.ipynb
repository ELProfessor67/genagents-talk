    "    [\"Interviewer: Tell me the story of your life in your own words.\\n\\nCarlos: I was born in Texas, but my parents immigrated from Mexico before I was born. They didn’t have much when they got here, so I grew up seeing them work long hours just to make ends meet. My dad was a mechanic, and my mom cleaned houses. I think that’s where my work ethic comes from. I was always into computers, even as a kid. I remember taking apart my family’s old Windows 98 desktop just to see how it worked. In high school, I got into coding—just messing around at first, but then I realized I could actually build things. That’s when I decided to study computer science.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: What were some major turning points in your life?\\n\\nCarlos: Going to college was huge for me. No one in my family had done it before, and at first, I felt completely lost. I almost dropped out after my first semester. But I found a professor who saw potential in me—he encouraged me to keep going and even helped me get an internship. Another big moment was landing my first job in tech. I had to prove myself more than some of my peers, but after a while, I started gaining respect.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: Tell me about your first job. What did you learn from it?\\n\\nCarlos: My first real job was in retail—stocking shelves at a grocery store. It wasn’t glamorous, but it taught me patience and discipline. My first software job was an internship at a startup. It was fast-paced, and I had to figure things out on my own. That experience shaped how I work today.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: Have you ever struggled financially?\\n\\nCarlos: Yeah, definitely. My parents didn’t have savings for college, so I worked while studying. I also had student loans. Even when I got my first full-time tech job, I wasn’t making a lot at first. Now, I’m in a better place, but I still try to be smart with my money—investing, saving, not overspending.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: How would you describe your political views?\\n\\nCarlos: I’d say I’m independent, but I lean progressive on social issues. I support things like affordable healthcare, better education, and immigration reform. But I also think the economy should encourage innovation and small businesses.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: Do you support a political party? Which one?\\n\\nCarlos: I don’t consider myself a Democrat or Republican. I vote based on the issues, not the party. I’d say in the last few elections, I’ve leaned Democrat, but there are things I don’t fully agree with on both sides.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: What are some political issues that matter to you?\\n\\nCarlos: Immigration is a big one—I’ve seen how hard it is for people like my parents to navigate the system. Also, education. A lot of kids in low-income communities don’t get the same opportunities. And then there’s tech policy—AI, privacy, and digital rights are becoming huge issues.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: How engaged are you in politics?\\n\\nCarlos: I vote in most elections, but I don’t post about politics online or anything. I’ll have discussions with friends, but I try not to argue—politics can get too emotional sometimes.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: How do you approach big decisions—quick gut feeling or careful analysis?\\n\\nCarlos: I usually analyze things first—look at the data, weigh the risks. But sometimes, you don’t have all the information, and that’s when intuition kicks in.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: What’s the hardest decision you’ve ever had to make?\\n\\nCarlos: Leaving my first full-time job. I had stability, but I wasn’t growing. Jumping to another company was risky, but in the end, it paid off.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: You’re given $100 to split with a stranger. How much do you give them?\\n\\nCarlos: Depends. If it’s a fair setting, maybe $50-$50. But if I don’t trust them to be fair, maybe $30-$70 to make sure I still get something.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: You can choose between a guaranteed $500 or a 50/50 shot at $1,000. Which do you take?\\n\\nCarlos: The guaranteed $500. I like calculated risks, but I don’t gamble on things I can’t control.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: Tell me about a time when you had to stay calm under pressure.\\n\\nCarlos: One time, we had a production issue at work—everything was breaking, and customers were affected. The team was panicking, but I focused on fixing the problem instead of getting caught up in the stress.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: What’s your go-to coping mechanism when life gets hard?\\n\\nCarlos: I step away for a bit—go for a run, play video games, or just unplug from everything. That helps me reset.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: Where do you see yourself in five years?\\n\\nCarlos: Hopefully leading a development team, maybe starting my own tech venture. I want to work on meaningful projects.\"],\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"Interviewer: If you could give advice to your younger self, what would it be?\\n\\nCarlos: Don’t be afraid to take risks, but always have a plan. And find mentors early on—they make a huge difference.\"]\n",
