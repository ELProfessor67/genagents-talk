They didn\u2019t have much when they got here, so I grew up seeing them work long hours just to make ends meet. My dad was a mechanic, and my mom cleaned houses. I think that\u2019s where my work ethic comes from. I was always into computers, even as a kid. I remember taking apart my family\u2019s old Windows 98 desktop just to see how it worked. In high school, I got into coding\u2014just messing around at first, but then I realized I could actually build things. That\u2019s when I decided to study computer science.",

No one in my family had done it before, and at first, I felt completely lost. I almost dropped out after my first semester. But I found a professor who saw potential in me\u2014he encouraged me to keep going and even helped me get an internship. Another big moment was landing my first job in tech. I had to prove myself more than some of my peers, but after a while, I started gaining respect.",
